# login-wp-admin-ftp

Place the code in your themes functions.php file or as a custom plugin. 

It allows you to visit a url such as  http://domain.com?autologin_please and be logged in as the admin. 

Note, once you've used the code to log in, it should be removed. It's not safe to leave code like this in your functions.php as anyone who visits that link would have full adminstrative access to your WordPress Admin. 

Handy if you have FTP access, but can't access the admin (locked out, forgot password and email recovery isn't working etc).
